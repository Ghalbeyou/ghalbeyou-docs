Let me introduce you to our small team.

### What do we want?

We want your satisfaction, we want you to be satisfied with our work and use it, if you want to donate, [<mark style="color:purple;">**click here**</mark>](https://patreon.com/ghalbeyou). Of course, our team has confidential members, but if the opportunity arises, we will announce the members.

### What are we now working?

We are now working on big projects, first we publish their tools and then we build the program itself. For example, we have published tools like Mc-Bot-Electron or ReadMeGenerator, each of which is suitable for one project. The opportunity is not much, but we are working on a whole project, all of which (80% of them) are free, which are open source on GitHub. I hope you are satisfied with our services.

### Why you are creating new apps?

We don't build new apps for money, but for trust and engagement. If you know, you will be shocked that we have so many projects, but we have not received any money from any of them! But, 20% of our big projects are maybe money makers. But, for now, we have many tools, we want you to take a look at it and fix it if there is a problem or send your suggestions.

### Who is the owner of this team?

The creator of this team is me, Arash Amini in Iran. I am a teenage programmer who is more interested in programming than my friends. I try my best to make the best



### Now, some random projects!

I have some suggested projects for you!
