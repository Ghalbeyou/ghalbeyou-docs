This is a Minecraft spigot 1.8 + plugin that also supports bungee cord. this plugin has a **AntiCheat** and the anticheat is so powerful, it will detect every cheat on the world.

We got the **AntiSpam** that is so powerful too, you can't send message two times. like if i sent a message "Hello" i can't do that later, or adding it a new things like "zhASD| Hello |jdi331" the antispam detect and removes the message. We got **AntiBot** and this won't allow even 1 bot join the server.

## Install

Sorry, not available!

### How to use?

This plugin no need to config, just use `/gs <what you want> <on|off>` . for example, i want to enable antispam : `/gs antispam on` and this will enable the antispam. you can enable also the messages for safty, like `/gs msg <on|off` and when its enabled, it will send random messages like "AntiCheat is enabled!" or ....

### How it works?

It's simple, for example lets do

#### AntiSpam

so AntiSpam is just if the user sents a message that contains his before message, it will removed.

#### AntiBot

This will won't allow blacklisted ips join server

#### Messages

Just a random message

### When it will be avaible?

The plugin is done, but its not gonna publish these days, maybe soon
