# â–¶ ReadMe Generator



## About

ReadMeGenerator is python application and with that you can create ReadMe.md files!\


### Install

Clone this respo with:

```bash
$ gh repo clone Ghalbeyou/ReadMeGenerator
```

then, go to folder and type:

```bash
$ python3 readme_generator.py <AppName> <GitHub URL> <GitHub Owner Username> <License> <Website URL> <Out File> 
```

And of course! we got a example for that, only for you!

```bash
$ python3 readme_generator.py MyApp https://github.com/ghalbeyou/MyApp ghalbeyou MIT https://ghalbeyou.github.io/MyApp README
```

So if you understand, this make a new file named as everything you enter on `out name` and it will add a .MD to the end of the file, so no need to give it in the terminal!

## How Does it works?

Just like other **READMEGENERATORS** , this app uses a themplate and edit it for the user, when the edit was done, it will write it to the `out name`.md and closes itself. Now here is a example of that:&#x20;
